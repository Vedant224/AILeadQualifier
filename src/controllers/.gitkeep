# Controllers Directory

This directory contains Express route controllers that handle HTTP requests and responses.

Controllers are responsible for:
- Request validation and parsing
- Calling appropriate service methods
- Formatting and returning responses
- Error handling and status codes

Each controller focuses on a specific domain (offers, leads, scoring, etc.)
